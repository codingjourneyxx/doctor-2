## FACIAL ANATOMY

### Lets talk about
- Most deadly poison on earth
- Most complex nonverbal communication – facial expression

### Five layers of face: Which layers muscles are?

**Facial Muscles:**
- Frontalis
- Procerus
- Corrugator supercilii
- Orbicularis oculi
- Depressor supercilii
- Nasalis
- Zygomaticus minor
- Zygomaticus major
- Levator anguli oris
- Orbicularis oris
- Levator labii superioris aleque nasii
- Levator labii superioris
- Buccinator
- Risorius
- Depressor anguli oris
- Depressor labii inferioris
- Mentalis
- Platysma

### Aging

- Bone resorption: sequel to various ageing signs,
- Wrinkles, folds, sagging, pigmentation etc.
- Facial muscles derived from 2ND pharyngeal arch, seventh nerve innervated.
- Most muscles morphological characteristic is that they do not insert to bone, ligament or joints, rather into the skin or in circular fashion.
- Facial muscles histologically have less stretch receptors so reduced contractility
- So, facial exercise, devices or application of muscle training are less effective

## HISTORY & DISCOVERY

- Btx discovery for aesthetics was a serendipity
- In 1987, ophthalmologist Jean Carruthers observed that frown lines disappeared after the use of botulinum toxin A for blepharospasm.
- In 1996, they published the first paper on the use of Botox for cosmetic purposes.
- In 2002, the FDA announced the approval of BOTOX® Cosmetic to temporarily improve the appearance of moderate-to-severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines).
- In July 2004, the FDA approved BOTOX® to treat severe underarm sweating, known as primary axillary hyperhidrosis, that cannot be managed by topical agents.

---

## MICROBIOLOGY

- Botulinum toxin (BTX or BoNT) is produced by Clostridium botulinum, a gram-positive anaerobic, spore forming bacillus.
- BoNT is broken into 7 neurotoxins (labeled as types A, B, C [C1, C2], D, E, F, and G), which are antigenically and serologically distinct but structurally similar.
- Type A is the most potent toxin, followed by types B and F toxin.

### Molecular Structure

The BoNT molecule is synthesized as a single chain (150 kD) and then cleaved to form the dichain molecule with a disulfide bridge.

**Light Chain (~50 kD):**
- Acts as a zinc (Zn2+) endopeptidase similar to tetanus toxin with proteolytic activity located at the N-terminal end.

**Heavy Chain (~100 kD):**
- Provides cholinergic specificity and is responsible for binding the toxin to presynaptic receptors
- It also promotes light-chain translocation across the endosomal membrane.

---

## MECHANISM OF ACTION

Botulinum toxins act at four different sites in the body:
- The neuromuscular junction
- Autonomic ganglia
- Postganglionic parasympathetic nerve endings
- Postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings that release acetylcholine.

### Mechanism of Action of Botulinum Toxin

**Process:**
1. C. botulinum → ACH-containing vesicles
2. Toxin blocks release of ACH from vesicles
3. Motor end plate → Stimulation blocked
4. Muscle fiber paralysis

### Synaptic Fusion Complex

- Release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction is mediated by the assembly of a synaptic fusion complex.
- Allows the membrane of the synaptic vesicle containing acetylcholine to fuse with the neuronal cell membrane.
- The synaptic fusion complex is a set of SNARE proteins, which include synaptobrevin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin.
- After membrane fusion, acetylcholine is released into the synaptic cleft and then bound by receptors on the muscle cell.

### Toxin Binding Process

- Botulinum toxin binds to the neuronal cell membrane at the nerve terminus and enters the neuron by endocytosis.
- The light chain of botulinum toxin cleaves specific sites on the SNARE proteins, preventing complete assembly of the synaptic fusion complex thereby blocking acetylcholine release.

### SNARE Protein Cleavage by Toxin Types

| Toxin Types | Target Protein |
|-------------|----------------|
| Types B, D, F, and G | Synaptobrevin |
| Types A, C, and E | SNAP-25 |
| Type C | Syntaxin |

- Without acetylcholine release, the muscle is unable to contract.

### Onset & Duration

- The toxin requires 24-72 hours to take effect, reflecting the time necessary to disrupt the synaptosomal process. In very rare circumstances, some individuals may require as many as five days for the full effect to be observed.
- **Peaking:** 10 days, the effect of botulinum toxin lasts nearly 8-12 weeks.

## INJECTION TECHNIQUES BY AREA

### The Glabellar Complex and Vertical Frown Lines

Glabella lines are created by the action of 3 muscles:
- The corrugator supercilli
- The procerus
- The depressor superciliis

**Before initiating the treatment:**
- Assess facial expression at rest and during animation
- Evaluate the range of motion of involved muscles
- Palpate muscles during repose and contraction
- Assess brow position

**Injection Sites:**
- Injections given into the corrugator (red and blue circles) and procerus (green circle) muscles.

**Caution:**
- Avoid injecting too low over the orbit
- Use caution with lateral brow injections; stay well above the superior orbital rim
- Do not completely paralyze the muscles

**Outcomes:**
- Vertical lines between the eyebrows and the horizontal ones across the root of the nose will diminish and eventually disappear
- Glabellar and midbrow corrugations
- There can be a noticeably high arching of the eyebrows of approximately 2–3 mm, caused by the levator action of the frontalis
- Increase in the horizontal distance between the eyebrows along with an elevation of the medial aspect of the eyebrows when glabellar frown
- To avoid a high arching brow in men, an additional 2–6 U of OnaBTX-A can be injected intradermally or intramuscularly into the frontalis 2.5–4.0 cm above the supraorbital ridge at the midpupillary line

---

### Horizontal Forehead Lines

**Muscle:** Frontalis

**Treatment Goal:** Achieve a balance between brow elevation with forehead smoothing.

**Before initiating the treatment:**
- Evaluate the patient's anatomy for expressivity, muscle mass, symmetry, lateral v/s medial movement, compensation for brow ptosis, and a narrow or wide brow.
- Injection given at blue circles and optional red Xs.

**Caution:**
- Less experienced injectors of botulinum toxin type A should stay at least 2 cm above the brow
- Ensure that injection sites are lateral enough to avoid a quizzical eyebrow appearance

---

### Crow's Feet

**Muscle:** Contraction of orbicularis oculi muscle.

**Treatment Goal:** Reducing dynamic rhytides and softening static rhytides.

**Before initiating the treatment:**
- Determine the source of the wrinkles - the orbicularis oculi vs zygomaticus major
- Assess while the patient animates and while he is at rest
- "snap test" to measure skin laxity along the lower lid margin

**Injection Sites:**
- Injection given in each of the 3 blue circles (photo) on each side and the red X's.

**Caution:**
- Treat around the lower third of the canthal area with caution
- Avoid the area below the zygomatic arch and the zygomaticus major muscle. Injection into this area has the potential to cause lip and cheek ptosis.
- Avoid veins, and treating patients who have a history of dry eyes
- Keep injections superficial; use intradermal or subdermal blebs with the needle oriented away from the orbit

**LOWER EYELID LINES:** jelly rolls

---

### Bunny Lines

**Muscle:** Contraction in the transverse portion of the nasalis.

**Treatment Goal:** Soften the bunny lines on smiling.

**Before initiating the treatment:**
- Patients should be asked to laugh, sniff, and to squint intensely, only become evident when smiling at maximum contraction.

**Injection Sites:**
- Injections given into the two blue circles. Sometimes an additional dorsal injection is required.

**Caution:**
- Avoid injecting in the levator labii alaeque nasi and the levator labii superioris to prevent drooping of the upper lip
- Do not massage vigorously or in a downward direction, could result in lip ptosis
- Keep injections superficial in this vascularized area to avoid bruising

---

### Nasal Ptosis, Nasal Flaring

Chin implant with btx for nasal ptosis

---

### Dimpled Chin (Peau D'orange)

**Muscle:** Contraction of the mentalis causes a "cobblestone" appearance of the skin and possible deepening of the mentolabial crease.

**Treatment Goal:** Reduce the chin dimpling which adds to the rejuvination of lower face.

**Before initiating treatment:**
- Patient asked to animate which brings out the wrinkles.

**Injection Sites:**
- Typical treatment is via 1 central or 2 lateral injections, about one half to 1 cm above the chin (blue ovals)
- Injections should be kept at least 1 cm from the lower lip.

**Caution:**
- Avoid injecting the toxin too high, which can affect the orbicularis oris and cause lower lip incompetence and possibly, drooling
- Avoid injection in the depressor labii, which can cause the lower lip to depress
- Do not treat the case of dimpled chin who have hypertrophied mentalis

---

### Platysmal Bands

**Cause:** Occur due to diastasis of the midline platysmal muscle and loss of submental fat, give the appearance of turkey neck.

**Treatment Aim:** Reducing vertical bands that appear when the patient contracts the platysma.

**Technique:**
- Treated via a series of superficial/intradermal injections directly into the contracted muscular band
- The number of injection points depends on length of each band
- Grasping the band with the non-injecting hand might be helpful while injecting very superficially in the contracted muscle

**Caution:**
- Use caution to avoid dysphagia, dysphonia, and neck weakness; the strap muscles should be avoided
- Platysmal band injections do not substitute for surgical procedures and will not correct skin laxity and fat deposits. So patients should be counselled to have realistic expectations.

---

### Marionette Lines / Depressed Anguli Oris (DOA)

**Muscle:** Contraction of the depressor anguli oris or DAO. Deep marionette lines give the impression of being unhappy.

**Treatment Aim:** Reduce the muscular strength of the DAO and the fibers of the platysma and thereby induce a lift of the corners of the mouth while the patient is at rest.

**Injection Sites:**
- Typically treated via 1 injection point into the posterior aspect of each DAO
- Injections should be at least 1 cm lateral to the mouth corner to avoid adverse outcomes
- A second injection site may be added laterally to target the platysma

**Caution:**
- Avoid unintended placement of neurotoxin in the depressor labii inferioris
- Titrating the dose, starting with a low dose and titrating up, is advised

## ADVERSE EVENTS

### General Adverse Events

Sequelae that can occur at any site include:
- Pain
- Edema
- Erythema
- Ecchymosis
- Injection site pain
- Short-term hypersthesia

### Systemic Reactions

Generalised reactions including nausea, malaise, flulike symptoms and cutaneous eruptions may result from diffusion of neurotoxin into the systemic circulation, and are treated supportively based on symptoms. Systemic reactions are considered hypersensitivity to BoNT or one of the components (i.e. albumin or lactose) in the suspension.

**Headaches** were the most frequently reported adverse event in the initial trials of BoNTA-ONA for the treatment of glabellar lines, it is most likely a result of the injection technique and not the drug itself.

---

### Region-Specific Adverse Events

#### Glabellar Region

The most common complication in the treatment of the glabellar complex is **ptosis of the upper eyelid**.
- Caused by injections placed at or under the middle part between the eyebrows in the region of the midpupillary line
- Caused by diffusion of the toxin through the orbital septum, where it affects the upper eyelid levator muscle
- Occur as early as 48 hours or as late as 7-10 days following injection and can persist for 2-4 weeks

**Treatment:**
- Alpha-adrenergic agonists: apraclonidine 0.5% and phenylephrine hydrochloride (2.5%) eyedrops
- The treatment is symptomatic and 1-2 drops three times a day must be continued until ptosis resolves

#### Forehead

The most significant complication of treatment of the frontalis is **brow ptosis**.
- Results from overaggressive treatment with injections being placed too low on the forehead or from poor patient selection
- Treatment of the brow depressors (glabellar complex) can elevate the brow from 1-2 mm. Be conservative while treating forehead expression lines.

#### Crow's Feet

Complications in this area are:
- Bruising
- Diplopia
- Ectropion or a drooping lateral lower eyelid
- Asymmetric smile caused by injection of the zygomaticus major

#### Lower Face and Neck

Potential complications:
- Asymmetric smile
- Lip ptosis
- Cheek bite or incompetence of the mouth manifesting as drooling or dribbling

Platysmal injections in large doses to treat prominent vertical bands and horizontal neck lines may cause weakness of the neck flexors and dysphagia.

#### Palmo-plantar Hyperhidrosis

Temporary hand weakness and reduction in fine motor skills which can last several weeks; thus, injection sites should be spaced appropriately and injections should be placed superficially.

## TOPICAL BOTOX

BoNTA cream based on commercially viable ionic nanoparticle technology. (FDA approved in 2008)

Other formulations are under development.

### Advantages over conventional injections:
- Eliminate the need for multiple traumatic injections for better comfort
- Self administration
- Cause only a mild weakening; therefore, it is potentially safer for use in the areas where muscles are highly sensitive to smaller doses of the toxin.

---

## MICRO BOTOX / BABY BOTOX

Marketing term that typically refers to a low-dose Botox treatment

**Benefits:**
- Baby Botox can help you prevent or delay the formation of static lines by keeping your skin smooth and supple.
- Baby Botox can help you prevent or correct mild to moderate wrinkles by using a low-dose approach that preserves your natural expression.
